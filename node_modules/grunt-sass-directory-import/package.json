  "readme": "# grunt-sass-directory-import\n\n> Include all the _.scss files in a directory by including a dynamically maintained `_*.scss` file.\n\nIn Sass, it's impossible to important a directory full of `_*.scss` files ([partials](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials)) automatically, and [this answer from Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4779432/399077) probably explains why.\n\nBut for me, source order isn't important: I like to have directories full of partials that should be independent from each other, especially when I'm using a system like SMACSS, where I have things like directories full of modules, mixins, functions, etc.\n\nUsing this task, you just add an `_all.scss` to any directory where you'd like to be able to import everything. This task will write all the necessary @imports to it so that when you @import that `_all.scss` partial, you will import all other partials in the directory.\n\nNote: this plugin does not include non-partials, or `*.scss` files not prefixed by an underscore. Those get turned into regular `.css` files, and don't make sense to me as something that should be automatically swept up in other includes.\n\nYou can read more in [my original blog post](http://nateeagle.com/2013/03/30/import-a-whole-directory-with-sass-using-grunt/).\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-sass-directory-import --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sass-directory-import');\n```\n\n## The \"sass_directory_import\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `sass_directory_import` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n**Important:** When you execute your tasks, this task needs to be executed *before* your Compass task, or whatever task compiles your `*.scss` files.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  sass_directory_import: {\n    your_target: {\n      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.\n      files: {\n        // The file pattern to add @imports to.\n        // The name of the file is arbitrary - I like \"all\".\n        src: ['path/to/scss/files/**/_all.scss']\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.quiet\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault value: `False`\n\nBy default, this plugin outputs information about the files it finds to your Grunt output.\n\nSet to true to quiet this.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Default Options\nFind any _all.scss directories in your scss folder and subfolders and add @imports to them to any partials (`_*.scss` files) in that directory.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  sass_directory_import: {\n    files: {\n      src: ['src/scss/**/_all.scss']\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n#### Custom Options\nSearch for files named `_everything.scss` and suppress output to your Grunt process.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  sass_directory_import: {\n    options: {\n      quiet: true,\n    },\n    files: {\n      src: ['src/scss/**/_everything.scss']\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n9-6-2013 - Initial release.\n",
